== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I disable the regular featured image from displaying on a single post or page? =

For the Twenty Seventeen theme you can change the header.php file to disable the regular featured image.
For example:
(lines 44 - 49)

		// If a regular post or page, and not the front page, show the featured image.
		//  if ( has_post_thumbnail() && ( is_single() || ( is_page() && ! twentyseventeen_is_frontpage() ) ) ) :
		//    echo '<div class="single-featured-image-header">';
		//    the_post_thumbnail( 'twentyseventeen-featured-image' );
		//    echo '</div><!-- .single-featured-image-header -->';
		//  endif;
